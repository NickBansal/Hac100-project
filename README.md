# Bad Basket Project - FrontEnd

This year I entered into the HAC100 25 hour hackathon sprint working in a team of 4.

Our task was to create a webpage which made the user experience difficult and the web page to be a huge nuisance.

We had 24 hours to create an idea and exucte it. 

This is the project we created for which we were nomited for the best students project.
